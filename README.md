Requirements
Problem
Many traditional retailers are struggling to grow profitability and reach their customers. In a digital age with so many online stores, small companies need to rethink and reorganise the business model in order to meet the market needs.


Solution
The objective of this project is to develop an online store where customers can browse the product catalog and select the desired products. The selected items will be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout the items from the shopping cart will be displayed and the customer can pay the order. An email notification will be sent to the customer when the order is completed.


The website should include the following pages
- Landing page
- Product Catalog
- Login/Registration
- Contact us
- Admin panel
